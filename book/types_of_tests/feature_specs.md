## Feature Specs

Feature specs simulate a user opening your app in a browser and interacting with
the page. Since they test that the application works for the end user, they are
considered a form of **acceptance tests**, and you may hear them referred to as
such. When developing a new feature and practicing outside-in development, this
is where we'll typically start.
