## Example Application

This book comes with a bundled [example application], a Reddit clone called
Reddat. If you are unfamiliar with Reddit, it is an online community for posting
links and text posts. People can then comment on and upvote those posts. Ours
will be a simplified version with no users (anyone can post) and only link
posts. Make sure that you sign into GitHub before attempting to view the example
application and commit links, or you'll receive a 404 error.

[example application]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/testing-rails/tree/master/example_app

Most of the code samples included in the book come directly from commits in the
example application. At any point, you can check out the application locally and
check out those commits to explore solutions in progress.  For some solutions,
the entire change is not included in the chapter for the sake of focus and
brevity. However, you can see every change made for a solution in the example
commits.

The book is broken into chapters for specific topics in testing, which makes it
easier to use as a reference and learn about each part step by step. However,
it does make it more challenging to see how a single feature is developed that
requires multiple types of tests. To get a sense of how features develop
naturally please check out the app's [commit history] to see the code evolve one
feature at a time. Additionally, you'll find more tests to learn from that we
won't cover in the book.

Make sure to take a look at the application's [README], as it contains a summary
of the application and instructions for setting it up.
